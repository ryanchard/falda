 *  deliberately distinct from a parsed `action: "skip"` — a valid explicit
 *  skip is a successful decision; `undefined` means the batch entry is absent
 *  or fails structural/action/cardinality/membership validation. Reusing a
 *  skip sentinel would make a bad reply look like N deliberate skips and
 *  silently discard a whole chunk without any audit trace.
 *
 *  Decisions are correlated by their stated `candidate` index, never by
 *  array position. An out-of-range or non-integer index is dropped rather
 *  than applied: a lost decision costs one candidate, but a misattributed
 *  one writes a wrong consolidation into memory with no trace.
 *
 *  A repeated in-range index is NOT known to occur with real model output
 *  (no observed incident as of this writing) — this is defensive handling
 *  for a plausible malformed reply, not a fix for something seen in
 *  production. The FIRST valid decision for that index is kept; later
 *  occurrences (valid or not) cannot override it. Failing the whole
 *  candidate to force an individual retry would be disproportionate for an
 *  unobserved failure mode, so `onDuplicateIndex` is called instead so the
 *  caller can emit a non-fatal warning without changing which decision is
 *  applied. This is reported whenever an in-range candidate index repeats,
 *  regardless of whether either occurrence's decision is itself valid — a
 *  batch reply that names candidate 0 twice with two malformed decisions is
 *  just as much a contract violation as one with two valid-but-conflicting
 *  decisions, and an operator should see it either way. `onDuplicateIndex`
 *  is itself non-fatal to parsing: an exception from the callback is
 *  swallowed rather than propagated, so a misbehaving observer can never
 *  cause an otherwise-resolvable batch to fail.
 *
 *  Structural/action/cardinality/membership validation is applied by the
 *  shared validateConsolidationDecision helper; batch entries that fail it
 *  are left unresolved (individual retry), not silently converted to skip.
 *
 *  Tries to parse the payload as a JSON array first. That array is treated
 *  as the batch payload itself — returned as-is, including reporting any
 *  duplicate indices, even if every element in it turns out to be invalid —
 *  as long as at least one element declares an integer, in-range
 *  `candidate` field. Only when NONE of its elements look candidate-shaped
 *  (e.g. the "array" actually captured is a bare single-decision object's
 *  own `target_ids` field, whose elements are plain strings) does parsing
 *  fall back to line-by-line scanning for parseable JSON objects. This
 *  distinction matters: without it, a compact batch reply where every
 *  duplicate entry also happens to be structurally invalid would silently
 *  fall through to the line scan and lose its duplicate-index signal. */
